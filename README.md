# BlitzNote
[BlitzNote - on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blitznote)

This is a cross platform mobile app (Android and iOS) built using the Flutter SDK. My goal is to provide users with a tool to write and securely store notes for later reference.

### Features
- Safeguard notes with biometric authentication (Fingerprint and Face ID)
- Search notes by keyword
- Customize username in settings
