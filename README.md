# BlitzNote
This is a cross platform mobile app (Android and iOS) built using the Flutter SDK. My goal is to provide users with a tool to write and securely store notes for later reference.
### Features
- Safeguard notes with biometric authentication (Fingerprint and Face ID)
- Search notes by keyword
- Customize username in settings
### Install and Run
- Get started by [installing the Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 
- Clone this repository. 
- Open the top-level directory in Android Studio to run on an Android emulator.
- Open the 'ios' directory in XCode to run on an iOS emulator.
